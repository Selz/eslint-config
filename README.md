[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) configurations for Selz JavaScript projects.

We are hoping that people will try taking these and using them as they are. It would be nice
for all Selz JavaScript code to follow the same standards as much as possible.

# ES6

`.eslintrc`:

```javascript
{
    "extends": "@selz/eslint-config/es6"
}
```

# React

`.eslintrc`:

```javascript
{
    "extends": "@selz/eslint-config/react"
}
```
